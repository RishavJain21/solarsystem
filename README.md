# Solar System

This project is a computer graphics lab mini project that showcases a simulation of the solar system using OpenGL. It renders the sun, planets, and their respective orbits, providing an interactive and visually appealing representation of the celestial bodies.

## Prerequisites

- C programming language
- OpenGL library
- GLUT library

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/RishavJain21/solarsystem.git`
2. Compile the source code: `gcc -o solar_system solar_system.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut`
3. Run the executable: `./solar_system`

## Controls

- Use the mouse to rotate the view of the solar system.
- The simulation automatically animates the movement of the planets and their orbits.

## Features

- Renders the sun and the planets of the solar system.
- Displays the orbits of the planets.
- Animates the planets' movements and rotations.
- Provides an interactive 3D view of the solar system.

## Implementation Details

- The solar system is rendered using OpenGL's 3D graphics capabilities.
- The movements and rotations of the planets are achieved through the manipulation of transformation matrices.
- The program utilizes the GLUT library for window management and user input handling.

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed using the C programming language and the OpenGL library. We would like to express our gratitude to the developers and contributors of these technologies for their valuable work.
